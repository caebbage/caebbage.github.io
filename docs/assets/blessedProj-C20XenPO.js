## **Lessons Learned**\r
\r
**What went well:** This was my first game jam experience working with other people with formal pipeline experience. This was also my first time properly working with Unity’s animation system, and for what it is I’m happy with what I accomplished.\r
\r
**Areas of improvement:** Though I don’t feel what I did was lacking, I do wish I ultimately did more. Being a first-time experience, I had some trepidation into diving in fully at risk of possibly causing more work for the engineering team in the process, but I hope to be more hands-on in my game jam work in the future.\r
\r
**Closing thoughts:** For a game made within just 3 days, I feel very happy with what we made and the visuals that were put together. As someone who had a large say in the game’s visual direction, it’s quite satisfying to see those decisions come together into a final product.\r
