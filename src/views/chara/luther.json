  "desc": "Who is Luther White? Perhaps the easier question is― *who isn't he?*\n\nLuther is not a good person. Luther is not loveable, not capable of love. Luther is not strong, nor kind, nor someone worth caring about. Luther was born this way, and is incorrigible. Luther will not be remembered, in the end.\n\nAt least, it's easier to believe that this is true.",
